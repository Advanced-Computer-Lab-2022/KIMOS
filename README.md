# Motivation üî•
We built this website for **Canadian Chamber Of Commerce**. As we want to be part of their 
educational project because we believe it will be very beneficial for teens all around Egypt. As they got their own trustworthy instructors, unlike most of the other educational online systems.
Also, we are competing with more than 40+ teams to be the chosen project from the company as the chosen project will be awarded.



# Build Status üî®
- The dark mode is not fully functional as in some pages, the text color remained black, therefore in the dark mode, there were pages where the contrast of colors made it difficult to see.

- Course was deleted without any confirmation.

- For a user that is not registered in any course, an empty div was displayed instead of a text indicating there are no courses.
Instructor rating was reflected in the frontend.

- Once you decide to add the video, there is no option to reverse it.

- Graphs have static data.

- Months are repeated in the instructor's wallet.

- We forgot a static login request before requesting a refund which causes an authentication problem.

- An empty container appears when the user doesn't have any courses, instead, we should have written something like " No courses registered yet".

- Guests can't search for courses as we added an extra SIGNED IN verification in the backend function.


# Code Style üñ•Ô∏è 
JavaScript Standard Style where no configuration and the code
is formatted automatically.
However, in naming the classes in the scss files (not normal css) we followed the **BEM** convention, which works as follows 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/ 



# Tech/Framework used üëú

## Backend
- **NodeJS** 6.14.13
    - It is the main building block for our project, was used for building the backend and the front end as well as we are using React.
- **MongoDB** 
    - It is a NoSQL database. We used it as we don't have a fixed structure for our models and we wanted the data to be on the cloud.
- **Mongoose** 6.6.5
    - It is a library that is used along with NodeJS to manage the MongoDB and support us with functions to find/update/delete and much more any item in the Database.
- **Express** 4.18.2
    - A library to host the backend ( make it a server ) to allow communication with other clients.
- **country-to-currency** 1.0.6
    - A library to get the rate between two countries using their country code.
- **Bcrypt** 5.1.0
    - used to hash our passwords.
- **CORS**  2.8.5
    - used to allow Cross-origin-access between the frontend and the backend
- **cookie-parse** 1.4.6
    - Parse HTTP request cookies
- **stripe** 
    - To Secure transactions
- **Nodemon**
    - To restart the server on its own on changes instead of re-running it manually.

## Frontend


- **ReactJS** 18.2.0
    - Was used for building the frontend.
- **SASS** 1.55.0
    - SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet which is an extension to CSS. We used it to organize our styling sheets files as it can get out of hand as well as to use one of its awesome functionalities such as **mixins** which can be used to define a set of styling attributes and we can call it inside any selector and the same styling will be applied there.
- **Redux** 4.2.0
    - Redux is a global state management library. We used it for some variables as it would have been very complicated to keep sending the data from the parent to its child and so on. We used Redux to store the data that will be accessed from different parts of the project and keep them there so that they can be accessed easily.
- **Material UI (MUI5)** 5.11.2
    - React components library that provides us with many UI components such as buttons, modals, and switches. We used only one library to have a consistent UI throughout the website.
- **Axios** 1.1.3
    - A library to send HTTP requests. We used it to communicate with the backend to send and get data.
- **React-draggable** 4.4.5
    - Used to make the notes draggable across the screen.
- **RechartsJS** 2.1.16
    - A library that provides us with many graphs/charts to use.
- **JSpdf** 2.5.1
    - A library to create PDF files using HTML content.

# Tests üëÄ
We tested all of our APIs using POSTMAN. We wrote the URL we wanted to test, and provided the required data ( in the body of the request or in the query). And then, we check the response status and the data in the response and compared it with the data we expected to get from the database.



# How to Use? üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
 While you are in the parent folder
1) Run the backend using `cd backend && nodemon server.js` or `cd backend && npm start server`
2) Run the frontend using `cd frontend && npm start`
